The rainfall climatology was computed in the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/FatimaPillosu/RainThr_4FlashFloodFC_ecPointERA5

The grib files were retrieved from there, and saved in:
Data/Raw/Analysis/ERA5_ecPoint/tp_climate/tp_climate_12h_ERA5_ecPoint.grib # rainfall totals
Data/Raw/Analysis/ERA5_ecPoint/tp_climate/percs.npy # list of percentiles computed
